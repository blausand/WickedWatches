Wicked Watch - Mass Choreography App for Android
----------------------------------

Wicked Watch is by now just a clone of y20k's great webradio app Transistor.
It is meant to morph into an App with the following features:
- fixed source of audio stream in the local network
- downloads a bunch of samples dynamically
- has an __OSC__ interface to send and receive messages from a server to:
  - trigger playback of samples
  - live control for panning/levels of the webradio mixdown
  - update participant's current score
  - display questions to the participant
  - send back answers to the server
- user interface will display information about the game state
